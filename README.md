# RatesAPI Website (Currency exchange rates) (ratesapi.io)

## 2nd push, 27/12/2020 (EVERYTHING IN SCRIPT.JS IS COMMENTED OUT)

### Things done
* Did extremely basic Javascript and implemented RatesAPI

* Comments added to make js file more readable and easy to understand

### To-do/Features I want to add

* Add basic html and css to make website usable

* Allow user to compare exchange rates side by side (current and previous exchange rates)

* Add a history tab for user to see past inputs/exchanges made

* Possibly find another exchange rate API since RatesAPI is relatively simple/doesn't have many features

* Refresh page regularly to show live, accurate exchange rates

* Implement graphs to show currency history (Find another API to do this)
